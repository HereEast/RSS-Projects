Hi,
My name is Nastia and it's the third time I am recording this video. The first was way too long, the second — I failed, the third — I have no idea what happened, so... let's hope.
I've got this glass jar with papers with questions that I am going to answer. It doesn't make any sense, but I thought it would be way more fun than just a talking head. The first logical question to start:

**What do you do?**\
I am a graphic and visual designer, also an art director, also I do UI/UX — everything design. I work with events, tech startups, tech and design communities and human businesses (businesses I like).

**Would you be a good mentee?**\
The best!

**What's your professional background?**\
I’ve got experience at working in big outsource companies, startups, mobile game development, tech communities, and events, enjoying both hand- zone work and leading and mentoring creative teams. I did UI/UX, resales, branding, graphic design, and a lot of communication with clients and development teams.

**Fav city**\
London

**What's your education?**\
I am an international lawyer speaking three languages.

**What's your professional plans and ambitions?**\
I'd like to connect design and tech, and do a lot of creative coding and media and digital experiences. Probably, I will run my own studio.

**Fav book**\
Everything by Theodore Dreiser

**How many hours a day do you sleep?**\
5-6

**Nike or Adidas?**
Nike

**What's your motivation for programming?**\
I moved to Amsterdam, and the Dutch are the best in design but they lack tech skilled people. So I am planning to make programming one of my biggest advantages at the local market.

**Bad qualities**\
FOMO (Fear of missing out)

**What's your latest project?**\
Website design for a local short film director. And the current one is EMERGE, International Tech Conference, which I design and art direct.

**What's your hobby?**\
I used to read a lot, but now I learn a lot, so currently my hobbies are creative coding and 3D.

**What's your fav projects?**\
RS Conf 2019 and EMERGE Conf 2019

**Good qualities?**\
I am a quick thinker, I am really dedicated to work that I love and I think I am a good person.
